# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import spamblockers-api

client = spamwatch.Client('API_KEY')
```

```javascript
const SpamBlockers = require('spamblockers-api');

const client = new SpamBlockers.Client("API_KEY");
```

> Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key generated from the bot by using `/apikey generate`.

The API uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get a API key in the [official bot, maintained by Andrew Lane (a.k.a. Twit)](https://t.me/SpamBlockersBot).

The API expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key.
